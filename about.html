        <p>
          The Control Panel is the core of your FoodSpan experience. You register tags by swiping them past our scan pad, and then pressing a few buttons so we can deliver you a recommended spoilage date. In addition, the display shows you what tags you have in your fridge, and what's about to spoil soon.

        <h2 class="title text-center">Tags</h2>
        <p>
          The FoodSpan Tags are what you put on your food containers or bags. Simply attach the tag to you container, swipe it past the scan pad, press a category button, and voila! Your item is now registered in your FoodSpan fridge. The tags are uniquely patterned and numbered, making them easy to distinguish from a distance.

        <h2 class="title text-center">WebSpan</h2>
        <p>
          WebSpan acts as your Control Panel away from your fridge, available anywhere with internet access. WebSpan knows everything your Control Panel does: what's in your fridge, and what's about to spoil. It gives you an overview for all your panels and all your tags, all from the power and convenience of the web.

        <p>
          The FoodSpan Mobile Companion App gives you information about your fridge, all from the tap of your finger. Designed to be mobile-friendly, the Companion App lets you check in on what's in your fridge, and can notify you which tags are about to spoil. Just like the WebSpan app, you can get a mobile overview for all of your panels and tags.
