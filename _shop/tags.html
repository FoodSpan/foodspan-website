FoodSpan Tags are part of the FoodSpan core functionality, allowing you to register items with your control panel. That being said, fridges grow all the time, and your FoodSpan fridge can too! There are 100 FoodSpan tag designs available right now, with more coming soon: you can make your tags look stylish and fancy, and expand your FoodSpan fridge.

Registering your tag with your Control Panel is as easy as swiping, so don't worry about figuring out how to tag: just start tagging!
