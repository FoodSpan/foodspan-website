Instant Noodles is only going to get you one out of the four food groups, so get some awesome vegetables in there! They also add tons of flavour, and make your pot of noodles look pretty green! Some common vegetables for Instant Noodles include:

* Green Onions
* Bean Sprouts
* Lettuce
* Onions
* Broccoli
* Spinach
* Carrots
* Peas
* Mushrooms

You can find most of these foods at your local supermarkets for a pretty cheap price: look especially for ethnic Asian supermarkets, as noodle ingredients are pretty cheap there.

# 2. Noodles can be Eggcellent!

Eggs are often a staple for most kinds of foods, and instant noodles are no exception! You can cook them in many different ways: poached, boiled, omelette, or anything in between!

# 3. Give your instant noodles some meat!

People love meat, whether it's in your burger, grilled food, or even your noodles! You can toss in your pork, beef, or chicken to simmer while you're boiling your instant noodles, and it turns out amazing! Seafood works even better: shrimp, lobster, or fish doesn't taste fishy! It tastes even better when the meat juices soak into the soup!

# 4. Don't be a chicken, use Chicken Stock!

Drinking noodle soup is sooo tasty, especially on a cold day. But you don't want just the flavour packet and water in there! Adding some chicken soup stock can go a long way into making both the noodles and the soup a little chicken soup for the soul.

# 5. Get Saucy!

We love being saucy, especially with instant noodles! Soy Sauce, Sesame Oil, and Vinegar are some basic sauces you can add in; if you're feeling adventurous, try sriracha, Tabasco, or any other hot sauces. Get saucy!

# 6. Make your Instant Noodles Butter!

Adding Butter to your Ramen makes it taste smooooooth, just like butter. Give it a shot! If you're looking for creamier instant noodles, add some milk in too.
