Welcome to the FoodSpan website, and the FoodSpan Blog. Here, we hope to give you fresh news, tips, and tricks from FoodSpan and the FoodSpan community, and an insight to how our product was created, and why. Along the way, we'll toss in a bunch of food puns. But no spoilers!

Want to learn more about our product? Check out our [about page]({{site.baseurl}}/about/) to learn about our hardware product, or our [app page](https://foodspan.github.io/foodspan-app/) to find out more about our companion app systems. If you have any questions or want to contact the FoodSpan team, you can contact us [through the contact page]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/), [social media]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/), or individually from our [team page]({{site.baseurl}}/team/). Hopefully we're able to make FoodSpan the best product that it can be.
