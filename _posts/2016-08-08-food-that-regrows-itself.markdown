There's no doubt about it: food is expensive. The average Canadian household spends over [**$675 a month**](http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a05?lang=eng&id=2030028) on food, with $490 of that being store-bought food. No matter how much you try to avoid it, the supermarket often becomes your second home.

But what if I told you there was a way to *regrow vegetables* from the parts most people don't find very useful, like the roots of an onion or the bottom of a head of lettuce? It's as simple as plopping the vegetable in some water and... voil√†! After a few weeks, it'll regenerate itself and you'll have a new yummy ingredient to cook with.

Ready to learn how to save yourself some trips to the supermarket?

# 1. Green Onions
