**Hey there!** Welcome to Developer's Corner, a segment of the FoodSpan blog where we give you insight on how FoodSpan is developed! Hopefully we'll be able to make this a weekly segment, looking into product development, website development, mobile apps, and anything else tech related to FoodSpan. In addition, we'll get different devs every week, so you get to meet the FoodSpan dev team!

First things first, a formal introduction. I'm **Matthew Wang** (though people call me **Matt**), your lead developer: I'm the team lead for Website and Application Development, and helper with Product Development. In English, that means I've coded this website, web application (WebSpan), and our mobile companion apps, with the help of our awesome dev team! In addition, I help with product development, marketing, digital design, and anything else that needs help.

## Worktools

Marshal McLuhan once said:

What tools you use are pretty important, and that's no different in any form of development. I'm passionate about the technology stack that I do use, and it's pretty cool stuff. Let's go over what tools and applications I love to use.

### Applications

* [GitHub](https://github.com/malsf21) is a Git-based version control system, and it's pretty damn popular. We host all of our open-source code on GitHub, at our [organization](https://github.com/FoodSpan).
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) is my text editor of choice (pictured). It has a robust feature set, even better extendability, and it's made by the guys at GitHub. It works with every language, has thousands of plugins, and feels *pretty awesome*.
* [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop.html) is the industry standard for image-manipulation, and I'm lucky enough to have a school license for it. We've used the Adobe suite to make logos, banners, mockups, and most other images on the site.
* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) is our VOIP service. It's server-based, has different channels, varies member permissions, works on browsers and all other platforms, and most importantly, is **free**.

### Platforms, Frameworks, and Libraries

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is the static-site generator that we use to code and maintain this site. It makes writing blog posts like this a breeze, editing cross-site code a walk in the park, and general web development a piece of cake.
* [Ionic](http://ionic.io/) is the mobile cross-app framework that we use to make our FoodSpan mobile companion apps. Ionic is based on web technologies, which means that our app works on iOS, Android, and even the Windows Phone! Plus, cool CSS animations.
* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) is the microcontroller that we used for our product prototype: it has a vibrant community, awesome set of features and plugins, and looks pretty sleek. In addition, they have their own IDE and product set. Cool!
