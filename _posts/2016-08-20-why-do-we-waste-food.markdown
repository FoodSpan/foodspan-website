In all fairness, there are too many answers to the above question  for them to fit in this single blog post. (Also, I dread writing and having to use words to cover such a broad topic would be the end of me!) Consequently, I have decided to limit myself to two human shortcomings, my shortcomings, that lead to food waste and to provide a few of the solutions that work for me.

## 1.Reluctance

I’ll start with the one that I am the least proud of. In the rare occasions that I intentionally waste food - I really, really try to avoid this - it’s usually because there’s a leftover dish that I am reluctant to finish; for example, the week-old rice in the fridge’s corner or the odd loaves of bread buried in the closet’s. To my family’s dismay, I deliberately allow such foods to spoil to avoid eating them. As of now, I don’t know any solutions to this problem except learning to ‘suck it up’, sometimes literally, and accepting the fact that all meals (unfortunately) can’t be pizza. Sometimes, reminding myself how lucky I am to have food in the first place and how disrespectful it would be to waste it works too…

## 2.Forgetfulness

The number of times i’ve opened the fridge and smelled something funny only to find a savory sauce all gooey and moldy is quite embarrassing. It’s not that it was a crummy meal or that I procrastinated on eating it. I simply forgot it existed. To me, that is the most agonizing way to waste food. In order to minimise said occurrences, I try to monitor my food as much as possible. Either through conventional methods such as making containers visible in the fridge or by using food tracking tools - cough...FoodSpan*...cough - i’ve ensured that smelly surprises are a thing of the past and that I know the status of my food (most of the time).

## Conclusion

I really hope you enjoyed this post and that if it didn’t give you any insight into why people waste food you could at least relate to my experiences. I do not plan on blogging again anytime soon so you can thank Matt. W, FoodSpan’s lead developer, for this one-off.
